Getting Started:

When you first download the repo, there will be two folders:
- content
- game

I will explain what to do what these after providing some background. (You will simply need to run a script I've created
but please read through to understand what is going on.)

When in development, Dota 2 custom games are divided into two folders, which are but are in two different locations:
- one which is a subdirectory of "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\dota 2 beta\content\dota_addons"
- one which is a subdirectory of "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\dota 2 beta\game\dota_addons"

The first is referred to as the "content" folder for the custom game because it is under the "content" directory.
The second is referred to the "game" folder because it is under the "game" directory". 

Both are given the same name, which will be used as the name for the custom game by Dota Workshop Tools.

For example, I used the name "dota12v12rebalanced" and during development I must manage two folders: 
- "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\dota 2 beta\content\dota_addons\dota12v12rebalanced"
- "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\dota 2 beta\game\dota_addons\dota12v12rebalanced"

It is not practical to manage two folders in different directories.
What we can do is create a single folder somewhere else and, inside that folder,
create links to those two directories above so that we can work in this new folder
as if those two directories are contained within. (It even works with git!)

To make these shortcuts, we must:
move the "content" folder into:
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\dota 2 beta\content\dota_addons"
and rename it "dota12v12rebalanced", and
move the "game" folder into:
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\dota 2 beta\game\dota_addons"
and rename it "dota12v12rebalanced".

Then, in some new working directory, we create symbolic links to the newly renamed directories.

I have automated this with a very simple batch script: "setup_links.bat"

You can double click to run the script or execute it from the command prompt.
